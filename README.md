# SomePython
Personal Python 
- Here I will add codes in python as I do and learn
- Added an Introductory tutorial which I learnt from Edureka(you can google) in **Jupyter Notebook**. One may not find all but some essentials which I felt I would require to start.
## Note:
I use**_VSCode_** . Number of editors and IDLE's are there starting from **Notepad++ ,Sublimetext** etc. You can choose which you like.
